# Bluesky Stats

I wanted to know how many users come in monthly and daily so I started gathering the data from https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats on
a daily basis. Also because I was too lazy to setup the firehose setup to grab this number myself.

If you are looking for that you can check out his repo at https://github.com/ericvolp12/bsky-experiments

Obviously this needs to run for a couple of weeks/months to have value. Till then I'll check if everything works fine so far.
The first day is triggered manually so it might be off. This will not have meaningful impact on the data I assume.
